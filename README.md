I am a PhD student of in the institute for theoretical computer science in the Technical University of Graz in Austria. Under the supervision of Wolfgang Maass, I investigate theoretical models and simulation of neural networks which aim at revealing principles of brain computation. While I hope that my research will contribute to the development of machine intelligence that respect human morals and clinical advances, I am amazed to learn every day about how the brain makes us who we are though collaborations with biologist, mathematicians and neuromorphic enregineers. Beyond my current research I am a curious person always eager to discover, learn and teach about the wonders of Nature and human societies.

While I graduated from a competitive master of applied mathematics and machine learning in Paris, I have had the chance to work on Music information retreival and Psychoacoustics. This lead me to question the world about sound perception and underlying physical and neural mechanism behind sound perception. Beside bringing me into brain research, this was an opportunity to work with passion for sound and music technologies which was and remain my main hobby.
