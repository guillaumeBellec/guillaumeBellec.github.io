  I am a PhD student of in the Institute for Theoretical Computer Science in the Technical University of Graz in Austria. Under the supervision of Professor Wolfgang Maass, I investigate theoretical models and simulation of neural networks to reveal principles of brain computation. As a curious person I am always eager to discover about the wonders of Nature and human societies, and I am grateful to learn about it with the best experts through collaborative research projects. On the long term, I hope that my research will contribute to clinical progress and the development of machine intelligence that respect human morals. 

  Before starting my PhD, I graduated from a competitve double-master of Applied Mathematics and Machine Learning (at ENSTA Paristech and ENS Paris-Saclay). In this context I completed various lab rotations, one of which was driven by my passion for music, and it got me to study Psychoacoustics and Neuroscience. Ever since, I questioned myself about the neural mechanisms behind thoughts and perceptions.
