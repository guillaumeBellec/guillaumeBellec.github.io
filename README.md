  I develop theories to advance our understanding of brains and intelligent machines. I studied artificial intelligence during my Master in Paris and I completed my PhD with Wolfgang Maass in the Institute for Theoretical Computer Science of TU Graz in Austria. I am now a postdoc with Wulfram Gerstner in the Laboratory of Computational Neuroscience at EPFL in Switzerland.
